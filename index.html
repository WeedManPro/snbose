          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          Satyendra Nath Bose ( 1 January 1894 – 4 February 1974) was an Indian
          mathematician and physicist specializing in theoretical physics. He is
          best known for his work on quantum mechanics in the early 1920s, in
          developing the foundation for Bose statistics and the theory of the
          Bose condensate. A Fellow of the Royal Society, he was awarded India's
          second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, in 1954 by the
          Government of India.

          <h1>Early Life</h1>
          Bose was born in Calcutta (now Kolkata), the eldest of seven children
          in a Bengali Kayastha family. He was the only son, with six sisters
          after him. His ancestral home was in the village Bara Jagulia, in the
          district of Nadia, in the Bengal Presidency. His schooling began at
          the age of five, near his home. When his family moved to Goabagan, he
          was admitted into the New Indian School. In the final year of school,
          he was admitted into the Hindu School. He passed his entrance
          examination (matriculation) in 1909 and stood fifth in the order of
          merit. He next joined the intermediate science course at the
          Presidency College, Calcutta, where his teachers included Jagadish
          Chandra Bose, Sarada Prasanna Das, and Prafulla Chandra Ray.

          <h1>Research career</h1>
          Bose wrote a paper deriving Planck's quantum radiation law without any
          reference to classical physics by using a novel way of counting states
          with identical particles. This paper was seminal in creating the
          important field of quantum statistics. Though not accepted at once for
          publication, he sent the article directly to Albert Einstein in
          Germany. Einstein, recognising the importance of the paper, translated
          it into German himself and submitted it on Bose's behalf to the
          prestigious Zeitschrift für Physik. As a result of this recognition,
          Bose was able to work for two years in European X-ray and
          crystallography laboratories, during which he worked with Louis de
          Broglie, Marie Curie, and Einstein.

          <h1>Bose-Einstein statistics</h1>
          Bose-Einstein statistics, one of two possible ways in which a
          collection of indistinguishable particles may occupy a set of
          available discrete energy states. The aggregation of particles in the
          same state, which is characteristic of particles obeying Bose-Einstein
          statistics, accounts for the cohesive streaming of laser light and the
          frictionless creeping of superfluid helium. At very low temperatures
          near absolute zero, an agglomeration of atoms that obey these
          statistics can share the same quantum state in what is known as a
          Bose-Einstein condensate. The theory of this behaviour was developed
          (1924–25) by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein, who recognized
          that a collection of identical and indistinguishable particles can be
          distributed in this way.

          <h1>boson</h1>
          boson, subatomic particle with integral spin (i.e., angular momentum
          in quantum-mechanical units of 0, 1, etc.) that is governed by the
          Bose-Einstein statistics (q.v.). Bosons include mesons (e.g., pions
          and kaons), nuclei of even mass number (e.g., helium-4), and the
          particles required to embody the fields of quantum field theory (e.g.,
          photons and gluons). Bosons differ significantly from a group of
          subatomic particles known as fermions in that there is no limit to the
          number that can occupy the same quantum state. This behaviour gives
          rise, for example, to the remarkable properties of helium-4 when it is
          cooled to become a superfluid.

          <h1>Honours</h1>
          In 1937, Rabindranath Tagore dedicated his only book on science,
          Visva–Parichay, to Satyendra Nath Bose. Bose was honoured with the
          title Padma Vibhushan by the Indian Government in 1954. In 1959, he
          was appointed as the National Professor, the highest honour in the
          country for a scholar, a position he held for 15 years. In 1986, the
          S.N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences was established by an act
          of Parliament, Government of India, in Salt Lake, Calcutta.
          <br /><br />
          Bose became an adviser to the then newly formed Council of Scientific
          and Industrial Research. He was the president of the Indian Physical
          Society and the National Institute of Science. He was elected general
          president of the Indian Science Congress. He was the vice president
          and then the president of Indian Statistical Institute. In 1958, he
          became a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was nominated as member of
          Rajya Sabha.
          <br /><br />
          S.N. Bose was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics, for his
          contribution to Bose–Einstein statistics and the unified field theory.
